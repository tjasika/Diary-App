# Diary App ðŸ“–

### File Set-Up
I used pretty much the same set-up as in my 'Memory Game' project - I started by installing the necessary Node.js modules: Express, express-session, nodemon, bcrypt, mysql2, EJS, and dotenv. I used EJS as the templating engine and placed all my .ejs files in "views" folder. Static files like CSS and JavaScript are served from the "public" folder. 

### The Database
I created my database in MySQL Workbench. It has two tables: *User* and *Entry*.
The *User* table stores people's email, username, password (crypted), the date when they created their account and the date when they last logged in.
The *Entry* table stores the entry's title, date and content, and is connected to the *User* table via a foreign key.

### Styling
I went with a clean, modern, and simple look. Iâ€™m not a pro designer, but I did my best that the interface works well for the app and used a bit of AI to help me get a good layout.
The color palette is from *Material Palette* (https://www.materialpalette.com), the illustrations are from *StorySet* (https://storyset.com/people) , and the icons are from *Bootstrap Icons* (https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)  
For the layout, I initially wrote entire HTML structures for every page, using the same code over and over again - until I remembered there's a more efficient way to do it. Though it took me some time to fix the mess, I ended up creating the main layout, without writing the same code too many times. To achieve this, I used the *express-ejs-layout* module, allowing me to have the main layout in a single *main.ejs* file, in which I included the *navbar.ejs* file and the other files as the 'main content'.

### User authentification
The user authentification was not my primary goal for this project, so I kept it simple. The email and the username must be unique, but the email is not verified (I only used the 'email' input type).

### The app logic
Upon logging in, users are greeted with a personalized dashboard displaying a welcome message, todayâ€™s date, and their three most recent diary entries.
Clicking the "Add Entry" button takes them to a form where they can:
- Enter a custom title or select from a list of prompt suggestions
- Choose a date for the entry (defaults to today if left empty)
- Write the content of their entry
    
After submitting, the user is redirected to a page showing all their entries. Each entry can be clicked to view its full content, and users have the option to delete any entry. Before submitting or deleting, a confirmation modal ensures the user truly wants to proceed.
#### So how does it work?
Each page has its own .ejs file, which is served to the user via a GET route. They all fetch data from the database via a simple SELECT query, pass it to the .ejs file, which then displays it. They all first check if the user is logged in - if not, they are redirected to the login page.

The data is manipulated via the POST routes: the */newentry* route inserts the necessary data (User ID, entry title, content and date) into the *entry* table. The user is not required to select a date in the form - if none is selected, the today's date is set automatically. The */delete-entry* route deletes an entry from the database, which cannot be undone.

The */fullentry/:id* route displays an entry in its entirety. If authenticated, the app retrieves the entry with the given ID from the database, ensuring it belongs to the currently logged-in user. This check protects against unauthorized access to other usersâ€™ entries. If the entry exists and is accessible, its full details (title, date, and content) are rendered on a dedicated page. If the entry doesn't exist or an error occurs during the query, the user is either shown an appropriate error or redirected back to the entries page.
