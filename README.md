### The Database
I created my database in MySQL Workbench. It has two tables: *User* and *Entry*.
The *User* table stores people's email, username, password (crypted), the date when they created their account and the date when they last logged in.
The *Entry* table stores the entry's title, date and content, and is connected to the *User* table via a foreign key.

### User authentification
The user authentification was not my primary goal for this project, so I kept it simple. The email and the username must be unique, but the email is not verified (I only used the 'email' input type).
