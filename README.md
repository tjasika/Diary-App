# Diary App ðŸ“–
My Diary App lets users securely write, view, and manage daily journal entries. After logging in, users see their recent entries and can add new ones by choosing a title, date, and content. Entries are saved by date and can be viewed or deleted anytime. The app includes confirmation prompts to prevent accidental changes, making it a simple and safe way to keep a personal journal.

### File Set-Up
I used pretty much the same set-up as in my 'Memory Game' project - I started by installing the necessary Node.js modules: Express, express-session, nodemon, bcrypt, mysql2, EJS, and dotenv. I used EJS as the templating engine and placed all my .ejs files in "views" folder. Static files like CSS and JavaScript are served from the "public" folder. 

### The Database
I created my database in MySQL Workbench. It has two tables: *User* and *Entry*.
The *User* table stores people's email, username, password (crypted), the date when they created their account and the date when they last logged in.
The *Entry* table stores the entry's title, date and content, and is connected to the *User* table via a foreign key.

### Styling
I went with a clean, modern, and simple look. Iâ€™m not a pro designer, but I did my best that the interface works well for the app and used a bit of AI to help me get a good layout.
The color palette is from *Material Palette* (https://www.materialpalette.com), the illustrations are from *StorySet* (https://storyset.com/people) , and the icons are from *Bootstrap Icons* (https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)  
For the layout, I initially wrote entire HTML structures for every page, using the same code over and over again - until I remembered there's a more efficient way to do it. Though it took me some time to fix the mess, I ended up creating the main layout, without writing the same code too many times. To achieve this, I used the *express-ejs-layout* module, allowing me to have the main layout in a single *main.ejs* file, in which I included the *navbar.ejs* file and the other files as the 'main content'.

### User authentification
The user authentification was not my primary goal for this project, so I kept it simple. The email and the username must be unique, but the email is not verified (I only used the 'email' input type).

### The app logic
Upon logging in, users are greeted with a personalized dashboard displaying a welcome message, todayâ€™s date, and their three most recent diary entries.
Clicking the "Add Entry" button takes them to a form where they can:
- Enter a custom title or select from a list of prompt suggestions
- Choose a date for the entry (defaults to today if left empty)
- Write the content of their entry
    
After submitting, the user is redirected to a page showing all their entries. Each entry can be clicked to view its full content, and users have the option to delete any entry. Before submitting or deleting, a confirmation modal ensures the user truly wants to proceed.

#### So how does it work?
Each page has its own .ejs file, which is served to the user via a GET route, which manages page rendering and data retrieval. They all fetch data from the database via a simple SELECT query, pass it to the .ejs file, which then displays it. They all first check if the user is logged in - if not, they are redirected to the login page.
The root route *(/)* serves the dashboard, showing the userâ€™s three most recent entries along with a welcome message. The */entries* route lists all entries by the logged-in user, ordered by date. For viewing a specific entry in full, the */fullentry/:id* route fetches the entry by its ID, ensuring it belongs to the user before rendering it.

The */newentry* route displays the form to add a new entry, while the /account route fetches and shows the userâ€™s account details like email, username, and usage dates. Each route checks for a valid user session to secure the content and redirects to login if the user is not authenticated.

Data manipulation is handled through the POST routes. The /newentry route accepts form data to insert a new entry into the database, including the user ID, title, content, and date. If the user does not specify a date, the current date is automatically assigned. The route also validates that the content is not empty before saving. The /delete-entry route allows users to delete an entry by its ID, ensuring the entry belongs to the logged-in user. Once deleted, this action cannot be undone. Both routes handle errors gracefully and redirect the user appropriately upon success or failure.
